            <p> The earliest forms of cigarettes were similar to their predecessor, the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar">cigar.</a>Cigarettes appear to have had
                antecedents in Mexico and Central America around the 9th century in the form of reeds and smoking tubes.
                The
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization">Maya</a> , and later the Aztecs, smoked
                tobacco
                and
                other psychoactive drugs in religious rituals and frequently
                depicted priests and deities smoking on pottery and temple engravings. The cigarette and the cigar were
                the
                most
                common methods of smoking in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central and South America until recent times.
                <br>

                The North American, Central American, and South American cigarette used various plant wrappers; when it
                was
                brought back to Spain, maize wrappers were introduced, and by the 17th century, fine paper. The
                resulting
                product was called papelate and is documented in Goya's paintings La Cometa, La Merienda en el
                Manzanares,
                and
                El juego de la pelota a pala (18th century). <br>

                By 1830, the cigarette had crossed into France, where it received the name cigarette; and in 1845, the
                French
                state tobacco monopoly began manufacturing them. The French word made its way into English in the 1840s.
                Some American reformers promoted the spelling cigaret, but this was never widespread and is now largely
                abandoned. Cigarettes are sometimes also called a fag in British slang. <br>

        <p> The first patented cigarette-making machine was invented by Juan Nepomuceno Adorno of Mexico in 1847. In the
            1850s, Turkish cigarette leaves had become popular. However, production climbed markedly when another
            cigarette-making machine was developed in the 1880s by James Albert Bonsack, which vastly increased the
            productivity of cigarette companies, which went from making about 40,000 hand-rolled cigarettes daily to
            around
            4 million. At the time, these imported cigarettes from America had significant sales among British
            smokers. </p>

        <p>
            In the English-speaking world, the use of tobacco in cigarette form became increasingly widespread during
            and after the Crimean War, when British soldiers began emulating their Ottoman Turkish comrades and Russian
            enemies, who had begun rolling and smoking tobacco in strips of old newspaper for lack of proper
            cigar-rolling leaf.[2] This was helped by the development of tobaccos suitable for cigarette use, and by the
            development of the Egyptian cigarette export industry.

            Cigarettes may have been initially used in a manner similar to pipes, cigars, and cigarillos and not
            inhaled.[citation needed] As cigarette tobacco became milder and more acidic, inhaling may have become
            perceived as more agreeable;[citation needed] a sentiment supported by advertising in the 1930s.[11]
            However, Helmuth von Moltke noticed in the 1830s that Ottomans (and he himself) inhaled the Turkish
            tobacco and Latakia from their pipes[12] (which are both initially sun-cured, acidic leaf varieties).

            The widespread smoking of cigarettes in the Western world is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. By the
            late 19th century cigarettes were known as coffin nails[13] but the link between lung cancer and smoking
            was not established until the 20th century.[14] German doctors were the first to make the link, and it
            led to the first antitobacco movement in Nazi Germany.[15][16][17]
