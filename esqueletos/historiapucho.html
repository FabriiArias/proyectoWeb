        The earliest forms of cigarettes were similar to their predecessor, the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar">cigar.</a>Cigarettes appear to have had
        antecedents in Mexico and Central America around the 9th century in the form of reeds and smoking tubes. The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization">Maya</a> , and later the Aztecs, smoked tobacco
        and
        other psychoactive drugs in religious rituals and frequently
        depicted priests and deities smoking on pottery and temple engravings. The cigarette and the cigar were the
        most
        common methods of smoking in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central and South America until recent times. <br>

        The North American, Central American, and South American cigarette used various plant wrappers; when it was
        brought back to Spain, maize wrappers were introduced, and by the 17th century, fine paper. The resulting
        product was called papelate and is documented in Goya's paintings La Cometa, La Merienda en el Manzanares,
        and
        El juego de la pelota a pala (18th century). <br>

        By 1830, the cigarette had crossed into France, where it received the name cigarette; and in 1845, the
        French
        state tobacco monopoly began manufacturing them. The French word made its way into English in the 1840s.
        Some American reformers promoted the spelling cigaret, but this was never widespread and is now largely
        abandoned. Cigarettes are sometimes also called a fag in British slang. <br>

        The first patented cigarette-making machine was invented by Juan Nepomuceno Adorno of Mexico in 1847. In the
        1850s, Turkish cigarette leaves had become popular. However, production climbed markedly when another
        cigarette-making machine was developed in the 1880s by James Albert Bonsack, which vastly increased the
        productivity of cigarette companies, which went from making about 40,000 hand-rolled cigarettes daily to
        around
        4 million. At the time, these imported cigarettes from America had significant sales among British
        smokers. <br>
