            <p> The earliest forms of cigarettes were similar to their predecessor, the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar">cigar.</a>Cigarettes appear to have had
                antecedents in Mexico and Central America around the 9th century in the form of reeds and smoking tubes.
                The
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization">Maya</a> , and later the Aztecs, smoked
                tobacco
                and
                other psychoactive drugs in religious rituals and frequently
                depicted priests and deities smoking on pottery and temple engravings. The cigarette and the cigar were
                the
                most
                common methods of smoking in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central and South America until recent times.
                <br>

                The North American, Central American, and South American cigarette used various plant wrappers; when it
                was
                brought back to Spain, maize wrappers were introduced, and by the 17th century, fine paper. The
                resulting
                product was called papelate and is documented in Goya's paintings La Cometa, La Merienda en el
                Manzanares,
                and
                El juego de la pelota a pala (18th century). <br>

                By 1830, the cigarette had crossed into France, where it received the name cigarette; and in 1845, the
                French
                state tobacco monopoly began manufacturing them. The French word made its way into English in the 1840s.
                Some American reformers promoted the spelling cigaret, but this was never widespread and is now largely
                abandoned. Cigarettes are sometimes also called a fag in British slang. <br> <br>

                The first patented cigarette-making machine was invented by Juan Nepomuceno Adorno of Mexico in 1847. In the
                1850s, Turkish cigarette leaves had become popular. However, production climbed markedly when another
                cigarette-making machine was developed in the 1880s by James Albert Bonsack, which vastly increased the
                productivity of cigarette companies, which went from making about 40,000 hand-rolled cigarettes daily to
                around
                4 million. At the time, these imported cigarettes from America had significant sales among British
                smokers.

            In the English-speaking world, the use of tobacco in cigarette form became increasingly widespread during
            and after the Crimean War, when British soldiers began emulating their Ottoman Turkish comrades and Russian
            enemies, who had begun rolling and smoking tobacco in strips of old newspaper for lack of proper
            cigar-rolling leaf.[2] This was helped by the development of tobaccos suitable for cigarette use, and by the
            development of the Egyptian cigarette export industry.

            Cigarettes may have been initially used in a manner similar to pipes, cigars, and cigarillos and not
            inhaled.[citation needed] As cigarette tobacco became milder and more acidic, inhaling may have become
            perceived as more agreeable;[citation needed] a sentiment supported by advertising in the 1930s.[11]
            However, Helmuth von Moltke noticed in the 1830s that Ottomans (and he himself) inhaled the Turkish
            tobacco and Latakia from their pipes[12] (which are both initially sun-cured, acidic leaf varieties).

            The widespread smoking of cigarettes in the Western world is largely a 20th-century phenomenon. By the
            late 19th century cigarettes were known as coffin nails[13] but the link between lung cancer and smoking
            was not established until the 20th century.[14] German doctors were the first to make the link, and it
            led to the first antitobacco movement in Nazi Germany.[15][16][17]
            <br> <br>
            During World War I and World War II, cigarettes were rationed to soldiers. During the Vietnam War,
            cigarettes were included with C-ration meals. In 1975, the U.S. government stopped putting cigarettes in
            military rations. During the second half of the 20th century, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoking
            started to become widely known and printed health warnings became common on cigarette packets.

            Graphical cigarette warning labels are a more effective method to communicate to the public the dangers of
            cigarette smoking.[18] Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Pakistan,
            Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru,[19] Greece, the Netherlands,[20] New Zealand, Norway, Hungary,
            the United Kingdom, France, Romania, Singapore, Egypt, Jordan, Nepal and Turkey all have both textual
            warnings and graphic visual images displaying, among other things, the damaging effects tobacco use has on
            the human body. The United States has implemented textual but not graphical warnings.

            The cigarette has evolved much since its conception; for example, the thin bands that travel transverse to
            the "axis of smoking" (thus forming circles along the length of the cigarette) are alternate sections of
            thin and thick paper to facilitate effective burning when being drawn, and retard burning when at rest.
            Synthetic particulate filters may remove some of the tar before it reaches the smoker. <br> <br>

            The "holy grail" for cigarette companies has been a cancer-free cigarette. On record, the closest historical
            attempt was produced by scientist James Mold. Under the name project TAME, he produced the XA cigarette.
            However, in 1978, his project was terminated.[21][22][23] <br> <br>

            Since 1950, the average nicotine and tar content of cigarettes has steadily fallen. Research has shown that
            the fall in overall nicotine content has led to smokers inhaling larger volumes per puff <br> <br>
